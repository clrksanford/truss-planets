# Star Wars Planets

Welcome to my Star Wars Planet site!

## Local Development

To begin working on this project, checkout the code, cd into the top-level directory, and run
```
npm install
```
followed by
```
npm run serve
```
Your terminal should tell you the URL where your site is being served (likely http://localhost:8080).


## Linting and Deploying

You can run the following command to check your code for lint errors:
```
npm run lint
```

When you are ready to build and deploy, simply run:
```
npm run build
```
